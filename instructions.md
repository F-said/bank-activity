# Instructions

You are a data engineer at a national Portuguese consumer bank, **Banking Objects of Portugal (BoFP)**.

Recently, a project has come across your team's desk to engineer a pipeline in Python to clean and re-structure consumer banking data. This pipeline will be used by the data analyst and machine learning team to clean and organize [terabytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYat9357mE) of data, which will subsequently be used to predict if someone is likely to purchase a [term deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp).

**Note**: If we were to do this in a traditional "big data" setting, we would most likely use something more powerful, such as [snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-pipelines-intro) or [databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databricks) (both products that we will take a look at later). However, it's not uncommon for small teams to engineer their own pipelines using a language like Python.

To achieve this, your team has decided to implement OOP "wrappers" in Python to capitalize on the functionality of the `pandas` package. Your coworker has completed some basic steps of this pipeline but now relies on your OOP knowledge and documentation-reading skills to complete the rest.

This repository represents an incomplete data engineering project that aims to satisfy the project goal above. We currently have a sample dataset of 45,000 customers to test this pipeline out. The sections below contain instructions as to what exactly you must complete.

This project version is the "normal difficulty." To tackle the "challenging" version instead, access the following [link]().

Utilize documentation, your peers, readings, and classroom notes to complete this project. 

## Validation.py

Before beginning your code, note the `code/test/validate.py` module in your project. 

You will use this script to validate if your code is running successfully as you complete each of the 3 parts. To validate if `Part 1: Data Combination & Cleansing` is working correctly, run

```bash
python code/test/validate.py pt1
```

To validate if both `Part 1: Data Combination & Cleansing` and `Part 2: Dummy Variables` is working correctly, you will run:

```bash
python code/test/validate.py pt2
```

And lastly, to run all 3 parts, including `Part 3: Feature Engineering`, you will run:

```bash
python code/test/validate.py pt3
```

## Part 1: Data Combination & Cleansing



## Part 2: Dummy Variables



## Part 3: Feature Engineering



## Part 4: Post Write-Up

Lastly, all good data science projects are flush with documentation where needed.

After completing the 3 parts above, you will move on to filling out the documentation in the `README.md` file. 

## Submission

The due date for this project is `10/31`.

To submit this project, you will push a completed version of this repository to your GitHub and post a link to your repo in Canvas.

**Note**: You must upload this to GitHub and submit a GitHub link to receive a grade for this project.
